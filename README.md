# Capstone_project_PleuraPro

PleuraPro is a breakthrough solution for pleural effusion management, specifically designed for cost-effectiveness in regions like Bangladesh. In our country, hospitals use cheap chest drainage bag that has some disadvantages- air backflow, overflow risk, hassle of continuous monitoring, one time usable, difficulty in hanging or keeping straight and some others. Unlike traditional drainage bag, our device features a silicone rubber one-way valve, eliminating the need for tube submersion and ensures respiratory ease. The device includes an alarm system with independent water level detection and motion sensitivity, utilizing minimal electrical current. PleuraPro is compact, reusable, and eco-friendly. Increased patient mobility, reduced physical monitoring, and substantial cost savings will  make PleuraPro a streamlined solution for efficient and affordable pleural effusion management.
